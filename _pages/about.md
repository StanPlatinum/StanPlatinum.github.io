### Weijie Liu's Here.

I am now an Associate Professor at Nankai University. Before that, I worked as a tech expert at Ant Group.

I did my Postdoc fellowship at Indiana University Bloomington (co-advised by [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/)). 
System Security is my main research area and I'm also interested in System Software, Software Engineering, and Image Processing.
