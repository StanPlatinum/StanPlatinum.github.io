### Weijie Liu's Here.

I am currently an Associate Professor at Nankai University. Prior to this, I served as a technical expert at Ant Group (2022-2024) and Tencent Group (2018).

I received my Bachelor's and Doctoral degrees at Wuhan University in 2012 and 2018, respectively.
From 2015 to 2016, I was a visiting student at SMU.
Subsequently, I completed my 3-year Postdoc fellowship at IUB (2019-2021).

System Security is my main research area, and I am passionate about System Software and Image Processing.
