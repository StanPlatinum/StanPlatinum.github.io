### Weijie Liu's Here.

I am currently an Associate Professor at Nankai University. Prior to this, I served as a technical expert at Ant Group (2022-2024) and Tencent Group (2018).

I embarked on my academic journey at Wuhan University, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in 2012 and later my Doctoral degree in 2018.
From 2015 to 2016, I had the privilege of being a visiting student at Singapore Management University. During this enriching period, I was fortunate to have [Prof. Debin Gao](https://dbgao.github.io/) and [Prof. Mike Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/) as my instructors.
Subsequently, I pursued a 3-year Postdoc fellowship at Indiana University Bloomington, jointly supervised by [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://wangxiaofeng7.github.io/) and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/).

System Security is my main research area, and I am passionate about System Software and AI.
