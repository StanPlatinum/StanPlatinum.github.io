### Weijie Liu's Here.

I am currently an Associate Professor at Nankai University. Prior to this, I served as a technical expert at Ant Group. 

I received my Bachelor and Doctor degrees of Engineering at Wuhan University in 2012 and 2018 respectively.
Subsequently, I completed my Postdoc fellowship at Indiana University Bloomington, under the co-supervision of [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/)). 

System Security constitutes my main research area, while I also have a passion for System Software, Software Engineering, and Image Processing.
