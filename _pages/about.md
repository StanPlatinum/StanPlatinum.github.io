I am currently an Associate Professor at Nankai University. Prior to this, I served as a technical expert at Ant Group (2022-2024) and Tencent (2018). [My short CV](/assets/liuweijie_cv_short.pdf).

I received my Bachelor's and Doctoral degrees at Wuhan University in 2012 and 2018 respectively, advised by [Prof. Lina Wang](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/info/1098/1762.htm). [My PhD dissertation in Chinese](/assets/pdf/Phd.pdf).

From 2015 to 2016, I was a visiting student at Singapore Management University. During that period, my instructors were [Prof. Debin Gao](https://dbgao.github.io/) and [Prof. Mike Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/).

Subsequently, I completed my 3-year Postdoc fellowship at Indiana University Bloomington, under the co-supervision of [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/).
