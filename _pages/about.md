### Hi, I'm Weijie Liu!

Iâ€™m doing my Postdoc fellowship, at Indiana University Bloomington (co-advised by [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/) and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/hatang/)). Before my post-doctoral academic life, I received my PhD Degree and Bachelor Degree both from Wuhan University, China. System Security is my main research area during the whole time from 2012. I'm also interested in System Software, High Performance Computing, and Software Engineering.
