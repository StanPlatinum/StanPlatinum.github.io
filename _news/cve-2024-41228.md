We have identified a symlink race condition vulnerability in Alibaba Group's rich container runtime Pouch, which has been assigned a CVE number: CVE-2024-41228, and is classified as a high-risk vulnerability (CVSS score 7.6).

***

A symlink vulnerability in the pouch cp function of Alibaba's open-source container, Pouch, could enable attackers to escalate privileges and arbitrarily write files. Tested with Pouch version 1.3.1, a race condition was identified in the cp command, similar to a Docker vulnerability. The flaw was traced back to Pouch's use of a vendored version of the affected package, which was not updated to the latest secure version.

An older version of the Pouch's package that was vulnerable to the race condition issue, even though Docker had resolved this in their updates. The discovery was reported to the Pouch team out of ethical responsibility, leading to a fix and the assignment of the CVE ID CVE-2024-41228 for the vulnerability.
